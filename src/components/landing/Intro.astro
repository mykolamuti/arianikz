        I'm Arian Nikhil, a self-taught blockchain engineer from Delhi focused on Solidity, smart contracts, and onchain systems on Base. I build agents, bots, and backend services that work with EVM contracts and indexers. Recently I've been heads-down on SUPERB — my AI-driven onchain agent — while shipping small developer tools, gas experiments, and au
